                         the GUI (Graphical User Interface) was making waves.<span class="break"></span>
                         Jobs and his colleagues were granted three-day access to the PARC facilities by Xerox on the condition that they are allowed to purchase stocks, a total of 100,000 Apple shares, at a pre-IPO price of $10 per share.

Also, it was around this time that Jobs began working on a smaller lower-cost computer after a brief scuttle and infighting concerning the Lisa computer.
                        <span class="break"></span>The two projects, one Lisa and the other the Macintosh project were solutions to the impending financial state of the Apple company. While Lisa eventually won the race, it didn’t make it big and instead incurred a huge commercial failure due to its limited software upgrades and high price tag.

Sculley was the then acting president of PepsiCo, Inc. and was whisked away by a shrewd comment by Steve, “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?”

                    <td>The conception of the Macintosh made Jobs’ uncompromising nature quite evident, from the design creation to its eventual launch. The resulting disagreements kept festering within the company and concerned Apple employees finally resulting in an open power struggle between Steve Jobs and Apple CEO John Sculley.
                        <span class="break"></span>While the board of directors wanted Sculley to contain Steve and let not his ventures result in expensive forays, Steve jobs instead planned to oust Sculley from his position. When Sculley caught wind of this scheme, he colluded with the stakeholders and finally succeeded in removing Jobs’ from his managerial position.
                        <span class="break"></span>Jobs then resigned from Apple and sold all but one Apple stock. Steve Wozniak also followed suit by de facto resigning from his high position and getting back to the Apple product development team to be more involved in the making than simply reigning.

                    <th>Steve Jobs Tryst with NeXT and Pixar Animation Studios – 1986</th>
                    <td>After Apple, Jobs’ then founded NeXT Inc., a computer company that specialized in workstations for universities and businesses; however, NeXT failed to gain traction in the marketplace.
                        <span class="break"></span>
                        The NeXT computer was funded by a Japanese electronics company and was noted for its engineering design. However, it was a costly venture and was eventually eclipsed by more cost-effective competitor products.
                        <span class="break"></span>
                        Soon after, Jobs purchased The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm Ltd., for $5 million. Over the next 15 years, Pixar Animation Studios released some of the most successful animated films of all time including Toy Story (1995), A Bug’s Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters Inc.(2001), Finding Nemo (2003), and more.

                    <td>
                        In late 1988, NeXT released its first NeXT computer with a tag of $6,500 a piece. It was received as largely cost-prohibitive due to its advanced workstation, but those who could afford it became its staunch supporters.
                        <span class="break"></span>
                        Steve Jobs managed to market the NeXT products to scientific and academic sponsors due to the innovative technologies incorporated in its production like the built-in Ethernet Port, Mach Kernel, and the digital signal processor chip.
                        <span class="break"></span>
                        A string of financial failures saw Apple changing hands from CEO John Sculley to president Michael Spindler. Then in 1994, Apple introduces the Power Macintosh Computers and decides to license its OS, thereby allowing its competitors to clone the Mac.
                        <span class="break"></span>
                        Contrastingly, Pixar’s Toy Story hits the theaters with an IPO raising $140 million.

                        The administration of Apple changes hands again, from Michael Spindler to Gil Amelio on February 2, 1996. After a thorough briefing on the admin management, Amelio learned that even prolonged efforts could not develop or produce an alternate for the aging Macintosh OS. Instead, he chose to purchase NeXT for $430 Million for the NeXTstep OS that Jobs’ and his team had developed.
                        <span class="break"></span>
                        This decision resulted in Jobs returning to Apple’s management while also laying the base for NeXT technology to become the foundation of the Mac OS X operating system.

                    <td>
                        When the board of directors at Apple were dissatisfied with Amelio’s capabilities to make Apple financially stable, they turned to Steve Jobs for help. As the interim CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs first scrapped the contracts of cloning the Mac technology and announced Apple’s partnership with Microsoft.
